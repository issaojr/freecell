# FREECELL v.1.0.1

This was the first game I programmed from start to finish. It was a project I did while I was a student in the Data Structures course, which was part of the Information Systems program at UFSCar (Federal University of São Carlos), in 2008. The experience was unforgettable, and I had a lot of fun programming this game.

Unfortunately, I ended up dropping out of the course because I needed a job to pay some basic bills. But I never stopped studying programming, even on my own.
